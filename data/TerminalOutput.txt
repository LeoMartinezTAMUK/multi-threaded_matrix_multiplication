Performing parallel matrix multiplication with 3 threads... (n>1)
Thread 0 will compute rows 0 to 0
Thread 1 will compute rows 1 to 1
Thread 0: Computed row 0 => Intermediate result: [30. 24. 18.]
Thread 1: Computed row 1 => Intermediate result: [84. 69. 54.]
Thread 2 will compute rows 2 to 2
Thread 2: Computed row 2 => Intermediate result: [138. 114.  90.]
Resultant Matrix:
[[ 30.  24.  18.]
 [ 84.  69.  54.]
 [138. 114.  90.]]
